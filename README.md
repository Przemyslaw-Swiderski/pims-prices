# Prices microservice as a part of Product Information Management System

## Overview
This project provides a sample Spring Boot application that serves as part of a microservice architecture for managing product information. Its primary goal is to simulate incremental development in alignment with Agile Scrum principles. Because it was developed without direct ties to real-world business constraints, this should be treated strictly as a demonstrative example.

## Backlog and Future Plans
Due to time constraints, an abbreviated backlog is outlined below, illustrating both the current state of the project and the intended direction for further development.
